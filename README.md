# Disasterman Legacy Repo

## About
Disasterman is my very first android game project, originally developed in 2018 for Android using LibGDX. It was published on Google Play with ads, and while it no longer installs on modern Android devices, the project remains close to my heart. To preserve it, I’ve decided to release the source code under the **Unlicense**, making it free and open for everyone.

The game has also been ported to HTML (via GWT) and is now playable directly on my website.

## Gameplay
- Planets fall from the top of the screen toward the bottom.
- The player must **tap planets** before they reach the bottom to make them explode.
- The player has an **HP bar** at the top, which decreases when planets pass the bottom un-tapped.
- Occasionally, **boss planets** appear with **orbiting asteroids**.
  - Each asteroid must be destroyed before the boss planet itself can be tapped.
  - Defeating a boss restores the player’s health.
